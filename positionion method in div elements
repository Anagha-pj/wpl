<h3>Relative positioned div</h3>
<p> An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
</p>
</div>
<div class="absolute">
<h2>Absolute Positioned Div</h3>
<p>
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling . Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements . </p>
